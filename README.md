## Project Name
Selection Sort
## About
This project implements the Selection Sort algorithm in JavaScript. Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element, gradually building the sorted portion.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js or a browser console) installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This SelectionSort includes these features:

-Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm with helper functions for swapping and finding the minimum index

-Handles sorting of integer arrays, including positive and negative numbers

-Includes sample arrays for demonstration

-Provides test cases to verify sorting correctness using assertions

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/SelectionSort.git`

## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (selection_sort.js) in a JavaScript environment, such as Node.js or a browser console: node selection_sort.js
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand the core mechanics of the Selection Sort algorithm, including minimum element selection and swapping

-Gain hands-on experience with JavaScript array manipulation and iteration

-Analyze basic time and space complexity (O(n²) time, O(1) space)

-Implement and test sorting functionality with multiple test cases
